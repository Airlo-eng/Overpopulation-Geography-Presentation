                        <strong>In the wild environments, </strong>Overpopulation can be a result of increased birth rates, less predation or large amounts of migration.

                        <strong>Overpopulation is the</strong> state of the population of a species being larger than its current environment can withstand. As a result, the species suffering from overpopulation will begin to fight for food, space and resources. Some animals in the overpopulated area may be forced to migrate to areas which are not usually inhabited or die from the lack of necessary resources.

                        <strong>In political environments, </strong>Overpopulation can be a result of a higher birth rate than death rate and lots of refugees, asylum-seekers and migrators.

                        <strong>Natural resources</strong> will be used up quicker due to the large amount of people you have to treat, such as food and medicine.
                        <strong>The environment</strong> will quickly decay due to the high use of resources, such as coal and oil, and the rise of the usage of vehicles, which would badly affect the quality of the air. The rise of CO2 emissions from vehicles will contribute to global warming aswell.

                        <strong>Wars and fights</strong> may start as a result of overpopulation in a country. Due to the lack of resources in that country, many people would be battling to get what they want and wars may start because of this. <strong>Unemployment rates</strong> would increase as there are fewer jobs to hand out to people, this would force people to turn to crime to make a living and cause more trouble.

                        <strong>The cost of living</strong> would increase as the margin between supply and demand expands, as this raises the price of essentials, such as food and shelter. This would also increase crime rates as many people would not be making enough to live and feed their families. <strong>Pandemics and epidemics</strong> would be more likely to spread as the living conditions become more unhygienic and healthcare prices continue to increase.

                        <strong>Family Planning</strong> can have a big impact, as demonstrated when Iran introduced a national family planning programme in 1989, it decreased its fertility rate by around 50% in a decade and Rwanda did the same thing and got 3x the results in just 5 years.

                        <strong>Government Incentives</strong> is very effective into solving overpopulation issues nationally. Many people are attracted to money and governments can easily solve issues like these with incentives.

                        <strong>One-Child legislation</strong> was attempted by China and was highly controversial. It is a policy that prohibits couples from having multiple children and had a very big impact by going from 6 births per woman all the way to 1.5 births per woman in a time period of 54 years. Unfortunately, the policy also led to manipulated and forced abortions.
